# python3-slackbot-selenium
Python3 quasi-slackbot written in Selenium. Meant to be run with cron if you don't have permissions to install real bots on Slack. The default install tells nerdy Chuck Norris jokes using a specified name.

##Requirements##
* Python3
* Chrome
* chromedriver (grab via `pip3 install chromedriver_installer`)
* selenium (grab via `pip3 install selenium`)

##Ideas##
This is just a framework. Feel free to replace the "jokes" portion with content of your choice, from an API, scrape, etc.
